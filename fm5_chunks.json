While planning may start an iteration of the operations process, planning does not stop with the production of an order. During preparation and execution, commanders and staffs continuously revise the plan based on changing circumstances and the assessed progress of an operation. An outcome of planning is a plan or order that that guides subordinates through each phase of an operation. Since planning is continuous, a plan or order is an interim product based on information and understanding at a moment that is subject to revision. The measure of a good plan is not whether execution transpires as planned, but whether the plan facilitates effective action in the face of unforeseen events.",

THE NATURE OF OPERATIONS 1-1. To understand the fundamentals of planning, Soldiers must appreciate the general nature of operations.

As friendly forces try to impose their will on enemy forces, enemy forces resist and seek to impose their will on friendly forces. A similar dynamic occurs among civilian groups whose own desires influence and are influenced by military operations. Appreciating these relationships among opposing human wills is essential to understanding the fundamental nature of operations. 1-2. Military operations are inherently dynamic and uncertain. The complexity of friendly and enemy organizations, unique combinations of terrain and weather, and the dynamic interactions among all participants create uncertainty. Chance and friction further increase the potential for chaos and uncertainty during operations. Chance pertains to unexpected events or changes beyond the control of friendly forces, while friction describes the obstacles that make the execution of even simple tasks difficult.",

The scale, scope, tempo, and lethality of large-scale combat operations add to the chaotic and uncertain nature of operations, making precise cause-and-effect determinations difficult or delayed. For example, a commander and staff may be uncertain about the exact location and strength of an enemy force. Even if the staff feels confident about the enemy\u2019s location and strength, the commander still questions what to infer from those facts-the enemy\u2019s intentions, for example. Even if the commander makes a reasonable inference, the many options available to the enemy make predicting the enemy\u2019s exact behavior difficult. Given the nature of operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a framework for action in the middle of it. PLANNING 1-4.",

In its simplest form, planning helps leaders determine how to move from the current state to a more desirable future state and identify opportunities and risks that may arise along the way. 1-5. Planning may be highly structured, involving the commander, staff, subordinate commanders, and others who develop a fully synchronized plan or order. Planning may also be less structured, involving the commander and leaders who quickly determine a scheme of maneuver for a hasty attack.

Common planning pitfalls include\u2014 \u2022 Lacking commander involvement. \u2022 Failing of the commander to make timely decisions. \u2022 Attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future. \u2022 Trying to plan in too much detail. \u2022 Using the plan as a script for execution. \u2022 Institutionalizing rigid planning methods. \u2022 Lacking a sufficient level of planning detail. 1-136. The first pitfall is the lack of commander involvement in the development of the plan. As discussed in paragraphs 1-84 through 1-96, the responsibility for planning is inherent in command. Commanders are the central figures in effective planning. Since the plan describes their visualization of the end state and how the force will achieve that end state, commanders must devote significant time and effort to the development of plans and orders.",

Pending or missing decisions can hinder the planning process and reduce developing a flexible and timely plan. In a rapidly changing and fluid environment, a lack of timely decisions can result in a loss of agility, initiative, or opportunities. The lack of timely decisions and timely plan development also inhibits subordinate planning and may unintentionally increase risk to the mission and force. 1-138. The third pitfall, attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future, may result from believing a plan can control the future. Planners tend to plan based on assumptions that the future will be a linear continuation of the present.",

The best analysis could simply be an understanding of what transition is most likely to occur, from which the most likely branches or sequels can be identified. Effective plans include sufficient branches and sequels to account for the nonlinear nature of events. 1-139. The fourth pitfall consists of trying to plan in too much detail. Sound plans include necessary details; however, planning in unnecessary detail consumes limited time and resources that subordinates need. This pitfall often stems from the desire to leave as little as possible to chance. In general, the less certain the situation, the fewer details a plan should include.",

A good plan only includes details needed to coordinate or synchronize actions of two or more subordinate units and accomplish the mission, achieve the objective, or produce the desired effect. 1-140. The fifth pitfall, using the plan as a script for execution, tries to prescribe the course of events with precision. When planners fail to recognize the limits of foresight and control, the plan can become a coercive and overly regulatory mechanism.

This pitfall tends to make planning rigidly focused on the process and produces plans that overly emphasize detailed procedures. Effective planning provides a disciplined framework for approaching and solving complex problems. Taking that discipline to the extreme often results in subordinates not getting plans on time or getting overly detailed plans instead of using mission-type orders. 1-142. The seventh pitfall is the danger of insufficient planning detail. While planning with too much detail may consume too much time, and result in plans which are overly constraining to subordinates, plans with too little detail result in unsynchronized and uncoordinated actions of subordinate units. Some operations, for example a gap crossing, air assault, or obstacle breach, require detailed planning to synchronize the coordinated actions of subordinate units to ensure success.",

Different commanders act at more than one level of war, depending on the echelon of command. For example, a combatant commander (CCDR) formulates theater strategy and designs the campaign plan. A land component commander assists a CCDR in campaign design and may lead a field army during major operations. The levels of warfare are conceptual, without finite limits or boundaries.

Culmination represents a crucial shift in relative combat power. It is relevant to both attackers and defenders at each level of warfare. On the offense, the culminating point occurs when the force cannot continue the attack, and it must assume the defensive or execute an operational pause. While conducting defensive operations, the culminating point occurs when the force can no longer defend itself and must withdraw or risk destruction. The culminating point is more difficult to identify when Army forces conduct stability tasks. Examples of conditions that may result in culmination include a unit being too dispersed to achieve security and units lacking required resources to achieve the end state. 2-77.",

However, for complicated problems involving a variety of factors, a systematic problem-solving approach is essential. How much analysis is required to effectively solve a problem depends on the problem\u2019s complexity, the leader\u2019s experience, and amount of time available. 3-3. Army problem solving supports a single leader working alone or a group of leaders working together. Commanders normally direct their staffs or subordinate leaders to work together to recommend solutions to problems. In formal situations, they present their recommendations as staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings. At lower echelons, recommendations are normally presented orally.",

Commanders with an assigned staff use the MDMP to organize and conduct their planning activities. The process helps leaders apply critical and creative thinking to analyze a mission; develop, analyze, and compare alternative courses of action (COAs); select the best COA; and produce an operation plan (OPLAN) or operation order (OPORD).",

Rather, the MDMP helps ensure plans contain a sufficient level of detail and direction for subordinates to effectively accomplish their assigned mission.

ADM assists commanders and staffs in understanding an operational environment (OE), framing the problem, and developing an operational approach to solve or manage the problem. The increased understanding and products resulting from ADM can then guide more detailed planning during the MDMP. (See Chapter 4 or refer to ATP 5-0.1 for more information on ADM.) 5-3.

During the COA analysis step, the staff, with guidance from the commander, analyze COAs to synchronize combat power and resources, identify and mitigate risk, exploit opportunities, reduce friction, and ultimately develop and improve the COA. It is a critical step in the MDMP, and commanders should allocate adequate time to complete it.",

Troop leading procedures is a dynamic process used by small-unit leaders to analyze a mission, develop a plan, and prepare for an operation (ADP 5-0). Company-level and smaller units use TLP because they lack the formal staffs to conduct the military decision-making process (MDMP).

This appendix provides a generic running estimate format that commanders and staff elements may modify to fit their functional areas. (See JP 5-0 for information on joint estimates.) TYPES OF RUNNING ESTIMATES C-1. Running estimates assist commanders and staffs with understanding situations, assessing progress, and making effective decisions throughout an operation. Effective plans and successful executions hinge on current and accurate running estimates with relevant information. C-2. Each staff section maintains a running estimate within its specified area of expertise (for example, intelligence, fires, logistics, or personnel). When building and maintaining a running estimate, staff sections monitor current operations, and they continuously consider the following in context of the operations\u2014 \u2022 Facts. \u2022 Assumptions.",

During planning, running estimates use these recommendations to select valid (meaning feasible, acceptable, suitable, distinguishable, and complete) courses of action (COAs) for further analysis. During preparation and execution, commanders use recommendations from running estimates to inform their decision making. C-4. While staffs maintain formal running estimates, the commander\u2019s estimate is a mental process directly tied to the commander\u2019s visualization. Commanders integrate personal knowledge of the situation, analysis of the mission variables, assessments by subordinate commanders and their organizations, and relevant details gained from running estimates from the staff to develop the commander\u2019s assessment.

An output of planning is a plan or order\u2014a directive for future action. Commanders issue plans and orders to subordinates to communicate their understanding of the situation and their vision for how the operation should unfold. Plans and orders synchronize the action of forces in time, space, and purpose to achieve objectives and accomplish the mission.

Plans come in many forms, and they vary in scope, complexity, and length of planning horizons. There are several types of plans, including\u2014 \u2022 Campaign plan. \u2022 Operation plan (OPLAN). \u2022 Supporting plan. \u2022 Branch. \u2022 Sequel. D-3.

An operation plan is a complete and detailed plan containing a full description of the concept of operations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time-phased force and deployment list (JP 5-0). An OPLAN may address an extended period that connects a series of objectives and operations, or it may be developed for a single part or phase of a long-term operation.

Establishing clear command and support relationships is fundamental to organizing any operation. These relationships establish clear responsibilities and authorities between subordinate and supporting units. Some command and support relationships (for example, tactical control [TACON]) limit the commander\u2019s authority to prescribe additional relationships. Knowing the inherent responsibilities of each command and support relationship allows commanders to effectively organize their forces and helps supporting commanders understand their unit\u2019s role in the organization.",

When possible, commanders maintain cohesive mission teams. They organize forces based on standing headquarters, their assigned forces, and habitual associations, when possible.

It defines key terms throughout and concludes by describing how and when decision tools are developed within the military decision-making process. DECISION SUPPORT TEMPLATE AND MATRIX F-1. Decision tools assist commanders and staffs in leading and executing operations. Among some of the most important tools are the decision support template (DST) and associated decision support matrix (DSM), execution matrix, and execution checklist. These tools help control operations and determine when anticipated decisions are required for execution. Decision support products are found in Annex C, Appendix 3 of the Army operation order (OPORD) format. (See ATP 2-01.3 for more information on decision support tools.) F-2.
